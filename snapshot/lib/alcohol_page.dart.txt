            "Alcohol and Sleep Architecture\n"
            "Alcohol is sedating, so it shortens the time it takes to fall asleep and increases deep slow-wave sleep in the first half of the night. But it comes at a cost: alcohol suppresses REM (rapid eye movement) sleep — the restorative stage tied to memory consolidation and emotional regulation — and fragments sleep in the second half of the night as it is metabolised.\n\n"
            "The First Night Off Alcohol\n"
            "Because alcohol suppresses REM dream sleep, the first nights without it often bring a REM rebound: vivid dreams and lighter, broken sleep while normal sleep patterns return. This is a normal, temporary part of recovery.\n\n"
            "Recovery Begins\n"
            "As the brain readjusts over the following days and weeks, REM and overall sleep quality improve. Sleep disturbance is one of the most persistent withdrawal-related symptoms, but it trends toward normal with sustained abstinence.\n\n"
            "A Note on Heavy Drinking\n"
            "For heavy or long-term daily drinkers, the first 24 hours can also bring withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, sweating, tremor, nausea). Severe withdrawal can be dangerous — if you have been drinking heavily every day, talk to a doctor before stopping abruptly.",

            "StatPearls documents that withdrawal symptoms appear within hours of the last drink — tremor, insomnia, agitation, sweating, raised heart rate and blood pressure — and that symptoms typically peak around 72 hours. Most people are over the worst of the acute phase by the end of day three. Severe withdrawal (seizures, or delirium tremens, which StatPearls notes can occur at any point up to 3 to 5 days after stopping or cutting down) is a medical emergency: heavy daily drinkers should not stop abruptly without medical advice.\n\n"
            "Cravings Come in Waves\n"
            "Cravings often intensify across the first several days, but an individual craving is short-lived — usually passing within minutes. Recognising that each wave subsides on its own makes them easier to ride out.\n\n"
            "Hydration Recovers\n"
            "Alcohol suppresses antidiuretic hormone (ADH), making the kidneys excrete more water and leaving regular drinkers chronically dehydrated. Once drinking stops, this diuretic effect ends and fluid balance begins to recover over the first few days — often noticed as clearer skin and steadier energy.\n\n"
            "Mind and Sleep Begin to Settle\n"
            "As the acute phase passes, the brain chemistry that alcohol disrupted (GABA and glutamate) starts to rebalance. Mental clarity improves and sleep — badly fragmented during early withdrawal — begins trending toward better quality over the first week.",

            "Alcohol weakens the immune system in several ways. Even one heavy drinking session can reduce infection-fighting ability for up to 24 hours. Long-term use reduces white blood cells, disrupts immune signals, and damages gut and lung defences, increasing the risk of infections and slow wound healing.\n\n"
            "Removing the Insult\n"
            "Many of these effects improve once alcohol is gone. White blood cells and immune signalling begin to recover, while the gut and airway defences start repairing. Within the first week, your immune system is no longer being knocked down daily and resistance to common infections begins to improve.\n\n"
            "A Gradual Process\n"

            "Chronic alcohol use shrinks the brain — partly through reversible reduction in cell size, not only permanent cell loss. With abstinence, the researchers measured an average global brain-volume gain of nearly 2%, concentrated around the cerebellum, midbrain, ventricles and frontal regions. Much of this regrowth happens early, in the first couple of weeks off alcohol.\n\n"

            "The Evidence\n"
            "This meta-analysis pooled 36 randomised trials (about 2,865 participants) testing what happens to blood pressure when people drink less. It found a clear, dose-dependent effect: the more someone cut back, the more their blood pressure dropped.\n\n"
            "How Big Is the Effect?\n"
            "People who drank two or fewer drinks a day saw no significant blood-pressure change from cutting back. Above that threshold, the effect was dose-dependent: it was strongest in people drinking six or more drinks a day who cut their intake by about half, where systolic blood pressure fell by about 5.5 mmHg and diastolic by about 4.0 mmHg on average. A reduction of that size is clinically meaningful — comparable to some blood-pressure medications and enough to lower long-term stroke and heart-disease risk.\n\n"
            "Why One Month Matters\n"
            "Alcohol raises blood pressure by activating the stress response, raising cortisol and stiffening blood vessels. The trials in this review show the benefit emerges over weeks of sustained reduction — so by around a month of abstinence, a heavier drinker's blood pressure has had time to settle toward a healthier level.\n\n"
            "A Threshold Effect\n"
            "The review found a clear threshold: benefit was concentrated in people drinking more than two drinks a day, and grew progressively larger the heavier the prior drinking. If you were a lighter drinker, don't expect this specific blood-pressure benefit — but heavier drinkers get a real, measurable cardiovascular payoff from stopping.",

            "The liver processes most of the alcohol you drink, and it takes the brunt of the damage. NIAAA describes a progression of alcohol-related liver injury: it begins with fatty liver (steatosis — fat building up in liver cells), can advance to alcoholic hepatitis (inflammation), and with prolonged heavy use to fibrosis and cirrhosis (scarring).\n\n"
            "The Earlier Stages Are Reversible\n"
            "The crucial point is that the liver is highly regenerative, and the early stages of this damage can improve when drinking stops. Fatty liver in particular often resolves with sustained abstinence. By around two months alcohol-free, the liver has had real time to clear fat deposits, calm inflammation, and restore healthier function — typically reflected in falling liver-enzyme levels (ALT and AST).\n\n"
            "Beyond the Liver\n"

            "Two specific abilities stand out as recovering earlier than the rest: basic processing speed (the review found this typically recovers by about one month, though accuracy on more complex tasks lags behind) and working memory updating. By around the three-month mark, many people already notice these lifting.\n\n"
